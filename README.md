# Summer_Projects_2018
Making games over the Summer of 2018 to develop programming skills
## Ideas
* Platformer
* Ships Part II Shooting at each other
* Text based game using tkinter
* Others...

I added the classes of the ships game to this repo so we can use/edit/reference them for anything new we want to make.
